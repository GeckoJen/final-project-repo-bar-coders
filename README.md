# Book Worms 

This app was created by The Bar Coders as our final 4-week project at the end of our School of Code Bootcamp.

## Project Description

### Our problem statement

There isn’t a modern way for teachers to engage with their students about their extra-curricular reading. 

As a teacher, I want a way to encourage my students to read outside of school.

As a pupil, I want a fun and engaging way to record how much I’m reading.

### Our solution
 
We created an app to solve this problem. It has two sides to it:
- the student side, which is aimed at 7-11 year old children to help them record their extra-curricular reading in a fun way; and 
- the teacher side, which aims to help teachers easily access their class's reading data both at a class level and at the individual child level.

## Technology used

The front-end (in this repo) is written in Next.js and deployed to Netlify, with an Express.js server at the back-end deployed to Heroku (this is in a separate repo).
